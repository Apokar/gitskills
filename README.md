Excuse me, I have some questions about jukebox, and I hope you can help me.

1. Does it take 3 hours to generate 20s music?

2. Is the GPU mandatory for generating music? Or just have a trained model.

3. Is there a trained model in the source code of GitHub? Can I skip the training and directly generate music?

4. I have very little experience in AI. Please forgive me for asking stupid questions.
